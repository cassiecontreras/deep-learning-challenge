Using my knowledge of machine learning and neural networks, I'll be using the features in the provided dataset to create a binary classifier that can predict whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.\n",

        "Overall, the deep learning model was around 73% accurate in predicting the classification problem. Using a model with greater correlation between input and output would likely result in higher prediction accuracy. I can achieve this by doing additional data cleanup up front, as well as by using a model with different activation functions and iterating until higher accuracy is reached."
